	<h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>We present a design prototype that demonstrates new locomotion techniques for social virtual reality experiences. Specifically, we
		showcase three teleportation-based techniques which, together, support
		users as they join other groups of people, and help them move together
		in virtual environments. The new interactions include a technique to
		join a group with option for adjacency, the ability to <q>reverse teleport</q>
		a user to your own group, and finding a consensus on where to teleport together. We argue that our new locomotion techniques maintain
		the simplicity of current teleportation-based techniques while supporting
		new interactions with people. We present our design prototype so that
		we can explore how new teleportation-based techniques can be designed
		to better support prosocial behaviour, but also highlight their potential
		to disrupt social experiences in social VR.

		<h2>1 Joining a group of people with adjacency</h2>
		<p>
			When teleporting we often use a small reticle on the ground and use point & click to navigate.
			In our demo we allow target people to be selected. When the user moves they are teleported to a new position using an <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/F-formation-arrangements-A-L-shaped-B-face-to-face-C-side-by-side-D_fig1_310819154" target="_blank">F-formation</a>.

		<h2>2 Reverse Teleporting</h2>
		<p>
			 Following the ability to move to a group, we might want to think about moving someone from a group to our position. This can again use an F-formation. We might use this when we need to coordinate movement with others quickly. However, thinking about consent is important. Designers should think about how you opt in or out of being reverse teleported.

		<h2>3 Stacked Reticles: Together Porting with a consensus on destination</h2>
		
		<p>
			Considering social teleporting or what we call Together-Porting we need to think about moving with others at the same time.
			When teleporting together we allow an existing teleport reticle to be selected. From the perspective of this second user, we show where the first user is going but offset to where we were teleport to, ensuring that we can easily see a shared destination but avoiding ending up in the exact same space.
